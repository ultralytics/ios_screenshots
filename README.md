# üìù Description

The [Ultralytics ios_screenshots repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ios_screenshots) is a powerful automated tool designed to simplify the workflow for [iOS](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/app/ios/) developers. By automatically resizing screenshot images to fit all the format requirements specified by the [Apple App Store](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#App-Store), this tool saves valuable time and ensures visual consistency across your app listings. For a practical demonstration, take a look at the iSky app created by Ultralytics, as seen below.
